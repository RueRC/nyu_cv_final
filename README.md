# NYU Computer Vision – Final Project

Hi, we are **Team Reconstructors**. This repository contains the final project for the **NYU Computer Vision** course.

The project explores benchmarking and analysis of multiple state-of-the-art visual geometry and reconstruction baselines, as well as a pedestrian behavior generation pipeline for simulation and data synthesis.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following branches, each corresponding to a specific component of the project:

- **`vggt`**  
  Benchmarking results using the baseline **VGGT** model.

- **`vggt-long`**  
  Benchmarking results using the baseline **VGGT-Long** model.

- **`DUSt3R`**  
  Benchmarking results using the baseline **DUSt3R** model.

- **`MUSt3R`**  
  Benchmarking results using the baseline **MUSt3R** model.

- **`pedgen`**  
  Monocular pedestrian behavior generation scripts for controlling pedestrian trajectories and behaviors in the **Unity Engine**, used for simulation and synthetic data generation.

## Notes

Each branch is self-contained and includes the code, configuration, and experimental setups.
